# Volkswagen-CO2-scandal
in September 2015, a scandal broke out in the automotive industry. It was found out that Volkswagen companies were misleading customers. The company declared that the cars were far less polluting than what they actually were. It is natural that Volkswagen lost market value, but the question is how much?

**01- Picking the Control Group** :

We need to pick stocks to run
Causal Impact. I recommend not
using other automotive
companies, because they might
have been affected by the scandal

**02- Correlation Matrix** :

The correlation matrix serves to
handpick the variables that have a
closer development with Volkswagen.
Only perform the correlation matrix
during the control period. Also, here
you need to consider stationarity.

**03- Measure the impact** :

Use Causal Impact to determine the
impact. For stock data, consider the
last value and evolution of the stock
price. For data like sales or visits,
you should look at cumulated.
